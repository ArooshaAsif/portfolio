            <h3>Task list Web App</h3>
            <p class="passage"> <br> I recently completed a Task List Web App project during my time with Codsoft. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or pending, with intuitive filter buttons and a responsive design for seamless use across devices. I used HTML5 for structuring content, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. This project significantly boosted my front-end development skills, deepening my knowledge of these technologies. I also improved my problem-solving abilities, code organization, and user interaction handling. You can check out the complete code and details on the GitHub repository.</p>
